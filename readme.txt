Project Title: Data Brokers Web Application

Credentials:

It is important to make a new storage as the credentials for the test application are
listed in a public repository. All the credentials within the code are purely for testing 
the project, and if there is any plan to use this in a real business, ensure that the 
different safety features are put in place. 

Project Description:

This project involved creating a web application that connected to firebase storage
and allowed a user to upload, retreive, delete, and modify excel files to the storage. 
Through the use of python, flask, and html, the project all runs together within the files
of the resository. 

OS - Windows and Mac

Technology:

Run on Visual Studio Code

Python V3.11.0- The coding language used to interact with the firebase storage and make any hard coding
changes to the application

Flask v2.2.2- A python package that allows connection between HTML and python code, and simplifies creating
web applications

HTML - Standard markup language for creating webpages, is what is used to create templates in flask

Additional Python Packages:

Flask - As mentioned before, a python package that allows the application to interact between the python code 
and HTML

Pandas v1.5.1- Standard python package that allows for interaction of excel files. Creates data frames that python
can then manipulate to change the data tables

Pyrebase - A python package that allows for certain interactions between firebase and the application, such as upload
and retrieve

Firebase_admin - Similar to pyrebase, allows additional administrative control for the application of the firebase
storage

Running the Project: 

If you install all the aforementioned packages and python has no issues since the creation of the project,
the application should run. Once the application starts, the command terminal should show that the application
has launched correctly and a web portal should be visible. The line that says "Running on -" will have a link
to the inital webpage of the application and it should display the login screen. From there all the application's
functions should be accessible.
